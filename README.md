# SVM digit classifier

This repository contains a pretrained SVM classifier for classifying digits on binary images.

## How to use

See the [src/examples.ipynb](https://github.com/andrinmeier/svm-digit-classifier/blob/main/src/examples.ipynb) file for an example on how to use the pretrained SVM classifier.
Please note that the model was trained on images that were resized to 64x64.
The features of an image are encoded using histogram of oriented gradients (HOG).
